# Mindustry Classic Soundtrack Mod
A mod that replaces the Mindustry in-game music to its Classic version.

[NOTE]
I'm a total noob at Java and Mindustry modding.
Anyone who knows how to reduce pauses between songs in-game, let me know.
Mindustry Classic music isn't designed for long pauses.

Mindustry Classic Soundtrack Mod by TheoDr
- It makes a backup of the game's desktop.jar, 
  and replaces the game music to music from the Classic version + 3 other tracks from the same artist, A Drop A Day.
- Lowered music volume to 60% is recommended.

Credits to A Drop A Day, the music artist.
